To better understand customer behavior analysis, we need to start from psychology. 
Behavioral analysis is one of the most common and discussed topics in psychology. This science is based on the foundations and principles of behaviorism.
[Behaviorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism) (or behaviourism) is a systematic approach to understanding the behavior of humans and other animals.

In psychology, the use of behavioral analysis is especially effective when working with children. However, business managers and marketers have adapted these concepts and ideas to improve customer relationships.
We must emphasize that, despite the importance of knowledge and experience in the field of psychology, 
business representatives must combine this theory with data science techniques in order to better understand customers.
